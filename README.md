# SAPNIN

**Act like a fucking human.**

A browser extension that kills low-effort engagement on Facebook.

## What it does

- **Kills the Like button** — React like a person or don't react at all
- **Kills the Sticker button** — No one needs these
- **Blocks emoji-only replies** — Use your words
- **Enforces 20 character minimum on comments** — If it's not worth a sentence, it's not worth saying
